                    <p>I have studied programming for nearly 5yrs now, first in High School in programming class where I studied the fundamentals of programming using Python. My senior year of high school I took an intro to web development where I started to learn how to build static front-end websites using HTML 5 and CSS 3. At Helio Training I jumped head-first into web development with their full stack immersive course. There I learned JavaScript and how to use frameworks such as react and build backend API's with Express. I especially enjoy the challenge of backend development. I pride myself in my constructive problem-solving skills which I feel programming really eventuates. I am also proficient in Adobe programs such as photoshop and illustrator and have taken design courses in both.  </p>
